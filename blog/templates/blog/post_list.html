            <p>I'm totally excited to be a part of Djangogirls team. It's a great opportunity for girls to enter IT world easily and without fear. Sometimes a lot of girld want to do it - but they are afraid to fail. Django is very clear and explained step by step. Everytime when you create something you are happy like a child. It's wonderful! .</p>
